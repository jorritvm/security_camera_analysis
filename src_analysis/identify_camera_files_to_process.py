"""
The goal of this module is to identify which folders need to be processed for object detection.
The main method must be called with a folder path corresponding to an annual upload folder (e.g. T:\reolink\2025)
The script will recurse into all folders and compare the contents to the contents of the detected_objects.json file.
Missing files will be listed as files to be processed.
The output is a list of file paths, one per line.
